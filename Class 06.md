> ## 1. History of Computer:

* **The computer as we know it today had its beginning with a 19th century English mathematics professor name Charles BabbageGenerally speaking, computers can be classified into three generations. Each generation lasted for a certain period of time,and each gave us either a new and improved computer or an improvement to the existing computer. **

* **First generation: 1937 – 1946 - In 1937 the first electronic digital computer was built by Dr. John V. Atanasoff and Clifford Berry. It was called the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC). In 1943 an electronic computer name the Colossus was built for the military. Other developments continued until in 1946 the first general– purpose digital computer, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) was built. It is said that this computer weighed 30 tons, and had 18,000 vacuum tubes which was used for processing. When this computer was turned on for the first time lights dim in sections of Philadelphia. Computers of this generation could only perform single task, and they had no operating system.**

* **Second generation: 1947 – 1962 - This generation of computers used transistors instead of vacuum tubes which were more reliable. In 1951 the first computer for commercial use was introduced to the public; the Universal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC 1). In 1953 the International Business Machine (IBM) 650 and 700 series computers made their mark in the computer world. During this generation of computers over 100 computer programming languages were developed, computers had memory and operating systems. Storage media such as tape and disk were in use also were printers for output.**

* **Third generation: 1963 - present - The invention of integrated circuit brought us the third generation of computers. With this invention computers became smaller, more powerful more reliable and they are able to run many different programs at the same time. In1980 Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-Dos) was born and in 1981 IBM introduced the personal computer (PC) for home and office use. Three years later Apple gave us the Macintosh computer with its icon driven interface and the 90s gave us Windows operating system.**

> ### A. Computer Input, Output, Proccess, Storage

  **Computer We know today was first invinted using vaccum tubes, scientes realized  that to design a computer the have to perform differnet tasks**
  
  1. Input 
  
  2. Storage 
  
  3. Processing 
  
  4. Output

 > ### B. Binary and Data 
 
 * computer send data through wires inside the computer by reprsenting it state with a puls on/off or zero/one, when the circut is closed it represent on and when its off it represent off the 0/1 called a bit and the more bits are data. 
 
 * all date in computer are translated to 0/1 through differant layers.
 
 * the zero one is called a binary system where its as same as the decimal numbering system

 > ### C. Circuts and Logic
 
 * **Circuts Deifinetion:** Complete path or combination of interconnected paths for electron flow in a computer. Computer circuits are binary in concept, having only two possible states. They use on-off switches (transistors) that are electrically opened and closed in nanoseconds and picoseconds (billionths and trillionths of a second).
 
 * Circuts are made of semiconductor where is the semiconductor are made from sand throw a ver long process

 **Computer Logic:** is made from gates where gates have different types like inverting the one to zero.

 > ### D. Cpu Input and Output
 
 ![cpu I/O](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Computer1.png)
 
 **CPU** take it data from computer peripherals through electric signal then it proccessed and saved on storage devices like hardisks or saved temperorly on RAM (Random Access Memory) for further use, after that it sends the CPU output like: screens and printers.

 > ### E. Hardware and Software
 
 **Hardware Definition:** Computer hardware refers to the physical parts of a computer and related devices, for example wires,chips and circuts
 
 **Software Definition:** instructions that tell a computer what to do. Software comprises the entire set of programs, procedures, and routines associated with the operation of a computer system
 
 **software gives the hardware command to execute throw simple logic and these command translated into thousands of zero's and one's  **

 > ###  F. operating systems
 
 **operating system (OS)** is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
 for example: Windows, Linux, Mac OS
