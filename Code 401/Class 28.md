> ## 1. RecyclerView for displaying lists of data

RecyclerView was introduced to ease displaying big data the recycler view dosen't destory the view, in fact it keeps holding the data even if the view is changed.for exmple the posts in facebook app is a Recycler View

* the RecyclerView is child class from the ViewGroup Class where the ViewGroup class hold the user defined views.


**How The RecyclerView Works:**

1. RecyclerView cobtauber for UI 

2. layout: Create your own or use one provided 

3. Adapter: manages collection and ViewHolder objects

4. ViewHolder: the views ( widgets ) in the list. note that the RecyclerView only creates to fill the current screen.

5. collection of data/objects.
