#### Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile

Responsive and adaptive web design are closely related, and often transposed as one in the same. Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change, while adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change. With responsive design websites continually and fluidly change based on different factors, such as viewport width, while adaptive websites are built to a group of preset factors. A combination of the two is ideal, providing the perfect formula for functional websites. Which term is used specifically doesn’t make a huge difference.

Mobile, on the other hand, generally means to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users.


Responsive web design is broken down into three main components:

  1. including flexible layouts: is building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width.
  
  2. media queries: are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or em units.
  
  3. media queries: used for mobile built

#### What is SMACSS?

**SMACSS** (pronounced “smacks”) is more style guide than rigid framework. There is no library within here for you to download or install. There is no git repository for you to clone. SMACSS is a way to examine your design process and as a way to fit those rigid frameworks into a flexible thought process. It is an attempt to document a consistent approach to site development when using CSS.
