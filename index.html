                Beekeeping (or apiculture) is the maintenance of bee colonies, commonly in man-made hives, by humans.
                Most
                such bees are honey bees in the genus Apis, but other honey-producing bees such as Melipona stingless
                bees
                are also kept. A beekeeper (or apiarist) keeps bees in order to collect their honey and other products
                that
                the hive produce (including beeswax, propolis, flower pollen, bee pollen, and royal jelly), to pollinate
                crops, or to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers. A location where bees are kept is called an
                apiary
                or "bee yard".

                            It might seem strange to order bees before you get everything else together for beekeeping,
                            but
                            it's
                            important because most places don't have bees for sale by the time spring is well underway.
                            January
                            is
                            the time to order your bees for shipment or pickup in April or May.
                            Local beekeeping associations are a great place to start asking around for bees. And you'll
                            want
                            to
                            decide whether package bees, nucs, catching a swarm, or buying an already-started hive is
                            the
                            right
                            choice for you. Each has its advantages and disadvantages.

                            Two main systems are used in beekeeping. One is called the Langstroth hive, and it's
                            composed of
                            boxes
                            that are stacked on top of each other, each containing frames where the bees build their
                            comb
                            and
                            store
                            honey. You pull the boxes out like drawers to access the bees, harvest honey, and perform
                            maintenance
                            tasks. You can add boxes vertically if your hive needs more space.

                            The other is a top-bar hive, where the bees' frames are arranged horizontally, not
                            vertically.
                            The
                            bees
                            make comb without foundation in this system. Each bar, containing comb and honey, is pulled
                            up
                            out
                            of
                            the hive from the top.

                            You'll need to choose which system is right for your needs. Most beekeepers use a Langstroth
                            hive.

                            Keeping bees requires an investment upfront in supplies. Once you've decided on the type of

                            you'll

                            feeding
                            supplies. You can also brush up on your bee information by reading some beginner beekeeping
                            books.

                            Month by month, season by season, bees need ongoing care. But they don't require a huge time
                            investment.
                            You must check on them somewhat frequently, but observation is a good percentage of what
                            you'll
                            do

                            keep your bees happy. Just watching hive activity can be relaxing and informative. You can
                            organize
                            beekeeping tasks by the season, from setting the bees up in spring to harvesting honey, to
