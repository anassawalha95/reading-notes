> ## 1. Database Normalization

![bd n](https://hackr.io/blog/dbms-normalization/thumbnail/large)

Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.  The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included. Take a spreadsheet containing the information as an example, where the data contains salespeople and customers serving several purposes:

 * Identify salespeople in your organization
 * List all customers your company calls upon to sell a product
 * Identify which salespeople call on specific customers.
