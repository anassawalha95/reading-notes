Ethics in the workplace: The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of

For this article I totaly agree with the writer. The writer descripes his working expreiance where he did create a form for a drug recommanding it that has a lot of side effects for consumers.
In fact now a days there is a lot of applications that has too much side effects on users especialy teenagers such as tiktok where it has light pollotion and reprogram their minds on silleness and nonsecnece with its content. For these kind of application my point of view is there should be some laws that inforces the publisher to remove these kind of apps.


Ethics in Technology: Big Data is our Civil Rights issue

New Technologies have introuduced a new ways and methods to use the data collected from users. In fact there the big data subject have started to knock the doors of the government, although governments are using it. The main issue with big data is that its outcomes where its used by marketers or banks to analyze users behavior and act upon it. of course it has many issues but it also have a good use such as preventing crisis and save a billion of dollors. The argument now is about the users data where its used against them self such as giving a loan baised on the user ethnicity, so for the best solution that I would implementing is ecripting every bit of users data and enforce it by the laws but for real who cares if the governments already uses it against it people.
