**What is Linked Lists:** a  Linked Lists methodology of saving data inside a memory randomly with different addresses not sequentially like array's and its limitations. also the linked uses the nodes approch where the first elemnt of the node preservre the value and the second preserve the next node address.

[Linked Lists and arrays](https://i1.faceprep.in/Companies-1/difference-between-arrays-and-linked-list.png)


**What is the types of Linked Lists:**

1. singly linked list: navigation goes only on way  forward. also each node here has two parts on is data and the seconed is the next node memory address 
2. doubly linked list: navigation goes backward and forward. also each node here has there parts the first is the previous node memory address, the second is the data, and the third is the next memory address of the next node  

**note:** in singly linked list the last node next address in null because its the end of the chine. In the mean while the first node first memory address is null and the last one is also null such as the chine

**The head and the current:**
head: represent the reference memory address.
current: represent the value that is being looked at.
