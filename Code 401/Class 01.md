**Language Basics**

1. **Variables**

  Java Variables is a container where it holds different type of data such as boolean true/false, strings, and objects.

** Java kinds of variables:**

   1. byte 
   2. short 
   3. int 
   4. long 
   5. float 
   6. double 
   7. char 
   8. boolean
   
   
2. **Operators**

  Operators in Java are symbols used to special operations like in javascript. The symbols used in java are +,-,>>,<<,<,>,~,%,&&,?,:,and ! all of these symbols are used alone or in combinations. the table below indicaties them with their combinations [the sourse](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/operators.html) 
  
|       Operators      |                Precedence               |
|:--------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| postfix              | expr++ expr--                           |
| unary                | ++expr --expr +expr -expr ~ !           |
| multiplicative       | * / %                                   |
| additive             | + -                                     |
| shift                | << >> >>>                               |
| relational           | < > <= >= instanceof                    |
| equality             | == !=                                   |
| bitwise AND          | &                                       |
| bitwise exclusive OR | ^                                       |
| bitwise inclusive OR | \|                                      |
| logical AND          | &&                                      |
| logical OR           | \|\|                                    |
| ternary              | ? :                                     |
| assignment           | = += -= *= /= %= &= ^= \|= <<= >>= >>>= |

3. **Expressions, Statements, and Blocks**

**Expressions:** is consists of variables, operators, literals, and method calls, such as `int age=10;`

**Statements:** is a one line of code that used to specifiy an action. for example `x=y+10;`

**Blocks:** a block or a code block is a set of statments of code that used to execute once its called or in an if statement or in a while loop , etc.

   For Example: 
   
         `if (x==1) { // begin block 
               System.out.println("x is 1.");
          } // end block 
          `



4. **Control Flow Statements**

Control flow statements are a set of reserved keywords that used to create for, while, do-while, break, continue, return, if-then, if-then-else, and switch for decision making, looping statements and branching statements

> ## 2.  Code Compiling

Code compiling is the transformation from the human readable code into machine languges which is 0's and 1's. Where the compiler it self is a program that runs the higher level code and checks if written correctly before appling it for the computers so it can understand it.

**Note:** Javascript uses interpreter where it will execute the code line by line then where there an error it will halt the program but the compiler check all the code before it execute it
