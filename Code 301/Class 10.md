> ## 1. The Call Stack defined on MDN
 
 A **call stack** is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.
 
 * When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
 * Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
 * When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
 * If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.
