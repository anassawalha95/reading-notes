**What is SuperAgent?** SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs.

**Example:**

              request
             .post('/api/pet')
             .send({ name: 'Manny', species: 'cat' })
             .set('X-API-Key', 'foobar')
             .set('Accept', 'application/json')
             .then(res => {
                alert('yay got ' + JSON.stringify(res.body));
             });
