> ## 1. Android Tasks and the Back Stack

**Tasks:** tasks in android is a set of activities that stacked on top of each others and thats what also called the back stack for task where the task is a stack that holds every single activity and every time a new activity is called the this activity will be pushed inside the task stack and once you press the back botton the stack will pop the last activity pushed .In the mean while you can avoid using the back stack in some manners such as search.

example:
